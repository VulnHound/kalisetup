# kalisetup
This is my own personal automated setup for any new and fresh Kali linux install. This is my first repo and I plan to add more in the future. 

VULNHOUND KALI SETUP

I originally made this short script to assist in the automation
of my Kali setup every time I load a new VM or have a fresh install.

The script will Update, Upgrade, and Add new packages

Tools also included:

- BBHT
- LazyRecon
- Asnlookup
- Massdns
- RED_HAWK
- Anon-Surf for kali

*MUST BE ROOT USER*

cd kalisetup
chmod +x kalisetup.sh
./kalisetup.sh
