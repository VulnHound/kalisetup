VULNHOUND KALI SETUP

I originally made this short script to assist in the automation
of my Kali setup every time I load a new VM or have a fresh install.

The script will Update, Upgrade, and Add new packages

Tools also included:

- BBHT
- LazyRecon
- Asnlookup
- Massdns
- RED_HAWK
- Anon-Surf for kali

*MUST BE ROOT USER*

Installation and USAGE:
                      
                        git clone https://github.com/VulnHound/kalisetup.git
                        
                        cd kalisetup

                        chmod +x kalisetup.sh

                        ./kalisetup.sh
