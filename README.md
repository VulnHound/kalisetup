# kalisetup
VULNHOUND KALI SETUP

I originally made this short script to assist in the automation
of my Kali setup every time I load a new VM or have a fresh install.

The script will Update, Upgrade, and Add new packages

Tools also included:

- BBHT
- LazyRecon
- Asnlookup
- Massdns
- RED_HAWK
- Anon-Surf for kali

*MUST BE ROOT USER*

cd kalisetup

chmod +x kalisetup.sh

./kalisetup.sh
